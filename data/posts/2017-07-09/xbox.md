I have a XBox One, and the major reason I have the XBox One rather than the PS4 is the controller (, and also its price tag). 
I have 2 PS4 controllers, 2 XBox One controllers, and a XBox 360 controller. The XBox One controller is just better in terms of ergonomics.

Recently, one of the controller failed on me, with one of the shoulder button LB not responding unless I press it really hard. The tactile switch for LB failed.
